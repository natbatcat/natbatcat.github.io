    <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <h5 class="justify">What are the Adoption Fees? </h5><p class="justify">The adoption fee is $60 for one cat/kitten and $100 for a pair. We waive adoption fees for special needs cats and cats/kittens that are adoption-sponsored.</p>
     <h5 class="justify"> Why do you have Adoption Fees?</h5> Adoption fees are used to help defray the costs of veterinary exams, feline testing, age-appropriate distemper and rabies vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and deworming.</p>
      <h5 class="justify"> Who Makes Adoption Decisions? </h5>The shelter manager and/or a shelter staff member with input from foster parent(s), if the cat/kitten is currently placed in a foster home, makes all final adoption decisions.</p>
      <h5 class="justify"> Why are kittens adopted in pairs? </h5>Unless an adoptive family already has a kitten that is close in age to an adopted kitten, we require the adoption of kittens in pairs. Cats are social animals and though they love their humans, they also require feline companionship to prevent loneliness, depression and/or destructive behavior.</p>
      <h5 class="justify"> Who can adopt kittens? </h5>We limit the adoption of kittens to adoptive families with children older than the age of six. If a family has children under the age of six, an adult cat must be selected for adoption. We have this policy because kittens are fragile and may be accidentally injured by small children. Also, we don't want children to be scratched by a kitten and develop an unnatural fear of felines.</p>

You should also consider energy level and whether the dog has any special needs. Do a little research before falling in love with a dog at the shelter so that you know the dog will be right for you and your family's lifestyle. Remember. adoption is a lifelong commitment.</p>
